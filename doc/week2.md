# Week 2

**Time spent?**

Task: Cross out DEFLATE, create week2.md
Time spent: ~2min

Task: Collect sample files
Time spent: 30min

Task: Read about huffman and begin implementation
Time spent: 6h?

Task: Setup and document coverage
Time spent: 10min

**What did I learn?**

Working on the project forced me to think about the steps and their order.

**What did I not learn?**

The time was mostly spent setting up prerequisites for the huffman tree, so I didn't properly look into how to correctly assemble the huffman tree. Next week I can start with this problem.

**Project progress?**

Huffman implementation started.

- Most of the necessary data structures are in place.
- Can correctly count bytes in input data.
- Can build a tree, although the output fails tests. The tests themselves also need to be re-evaluated.
