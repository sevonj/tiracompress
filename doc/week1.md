# Week 1

**Time spent?**

Task: Read about common compression algorithms
Time spent: ~2h

Task: Read about common encryption algorithms
Time spent: <1h

Task: Read about JPEG compression and draft a specification for *The Jraphics Compressor.* (This was my original plan, however I decided that I really don't want to commit into building a fast DCT implementation.)
Time spent: 5h?

Task: Choose a simpler problem from the examples, write spec & report, setup repo.
Time spent: 3h

**What did I learn?**

I now possess a lot of surface level information about data compression.

**What did I not learn?**

I did not look deep into LZ77 at all. Also, finding information about faster than O(*n*Â²) DCT algorithms that I could understand turned out quite difficult, hence the change of subject.

**Project progress?**

I have a hello world.
